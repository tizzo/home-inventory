# Development Guidelines for AI Agents

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Follow red-green-refactor cycle where possible
- Write failing tests first, then implement to pass
- Refactor after tests pass

## Code Quality - Before Any Commit
1. **TypeScript**: 
   - Use strict typing (no `any` types)
   - Run `npm run type-check` and resolve all issues
   - Run `prettier --write .` for formatting
   - Run `npm run lint` and fix all issues

2. **Rust**:
   - Run `cargo fmt` for formatting
   - Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and resolve all issues
   - Fix all clippy warnings before proceeding

3. **Tests**: 
   - Run all tests (`cargo test` for backend, `npm test` for frontend)
   - Ensure all tests pass before committing

## Git Commits
- NEVER commit until explicitly instructed by the user
- Use conventional commit format: `type: description`
- Author commits as the human developer (not as AI/Cursor/robot)
- Do not mention AI assistance in commit messages
- **Commit message format**:
  - Single line summary (50 chars or less)
  - Two blank lines
  - Full summary explaining WHY (not WHAT) the change was made
  - Example:
    ```
    feat: add user authentication system


    Enable secure access control to prevent unauthorized data access.
    Implements session-based auth with httpOnly cookies to protect
    against XSS attacks.
    ```
- **Commit messages should explain WHY the change was made, not WHAT was changed**
  - Bad: "Added error handling to user service"
  - Good: "Prevent crashes when API returns malformed user data"
  - Bad: "Updated Room model with new fields"
  - Good: "Support tracking room dimensions for space planning"
- **Prompt for commits regularly**: After completing a logical unit of work (feature, fix, refactor), remind the user that we may want to commit before moving on

## General Principles
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Provide context for changes in discussion, not in commits
- Run linters and formatters before proposing code as complete
